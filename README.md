LMA_project

For this project, we will use individual-level data from the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS).  

Research questions:
1. In the state of Washington, how do earnings vary by educational attainment?  ##earnings = wage*hours worked
2. Does the premium for higher education vary by race and ethnicity?


The Census Bureau provides each stateâ€™s data file in comma separated value (CSV) format.
We choose Washington State's data to analyze,
data source: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2016/1-Year/csv_pwa.zip

We will be using the population records (elsewhere called person records) rather than the housing records.  

The data dictionary provides variable names and codes; 
it's in this repository; the codes for the person records begin on page 35.

target columns:
1. AL: MAR(Marital status)
2. BS: WAGP (Wages or salary income past 12 months)
3. BN: SCHL (Educational attainment)
4. Race:RAC1P, RAC2P, RAC3P. Which one to use?

sample critieria:
1. according to the ratio of the races in the population, we randomly choose sample and keep the same ratio.

2. exclude the people who is in the following status: b, 3, 6 in the column: ESR 1 ---Employment status recode:
  b .N/A (less than 16 years old)        1 .Civilian employed, at work
  2 .Civilian employed, with a job but not at work       3 .Unemployed
  4 .Armed forces, at work      5 .Armed forces, with a job but not at work
