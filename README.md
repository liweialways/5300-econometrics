# 5300-econometrics
LMA_project

For this project, we will use individual-level data from the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS).  

The Census Bureau provides each stateâ€™s data file in comma separated value (CSV) format.
We choose Washington State's data to analyze,
data source: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2016/1-Year/csv_pwa.zip

We will be using the population records (elsewhere called person records) rather than the housing records.  

The data dictionary provides variable names and codes; 
it's in this repository; the codes for the person records begin on page 35.
